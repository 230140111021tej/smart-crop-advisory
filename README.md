# 🌾 Smart Crop Advisory System: India

**Intelligent, Data-Driven Crop Recommendation Platform for Indian Agriculture**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Smart Crop Advisory System is a full-stack machine learning web application designed to help Indian farmers, agronomists, and agricultural planners select the most suitable crop for their local conditions. By analyzing soil, weather, and nutrient parameters, the tool delivers actionable recommendations and confidence scores, supported by interactive visualizations.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Large, realistic Indian crop dataset** for robust ML training
- **Intelligent crop prediction** using Random Forest classifier
- **RESTful Flask API** backend
- **Interactive web frontend** with Bootstrap & Chart.js
- **Visual analytics:** Bar, Pie, and Radar charts for crop recommendations
- **Clear confidence scores** for all major crops
- **Comparison of user input vs. crop requirements**
- **Easy-to-use interface** for rapid insights

## 📊 How Results & Decisions Are Explained

### 1. **Model Outputs**
- The system returns **confidence scores for all major crops**, not just the best match. This transparency helps you see how close other crops are to your conditions.

### 2. **Visualizations**
- **Bar Chart:** Quickly spot which crops are most recommended.
- **Pie Chart:** See the distribution of confidence across crops.
- **Radar Chart:** Compare your soil/weather with typical crop requirements.

### 3. **Decision Support**
- The recommended crop is the one with the highest confidence.
- Charts show why a crop was recommended—if your conditions closely match the ideal, you'll see a high confidence.
- The radar chart highlights gaps between local conditions and crop requirements, supporting better agronomic decisions.

### 4. **Robust Dataset**
- Trained on a synthetic yet domain-accurate dataset with thousands of samples, covering India's major crops and realistic environmental parameters.

## 💡 Usage

1. **Train the model:**  
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. **Run the backend:**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. **Access the frontend:**  
   Open `predict.html` in your browser.

## 📈 Results

- **Diverse recommendations:** Model adapts to changing soil and weather.
- **Clear rationale:** Confidence scores and charts show *why* a crop was chosen.
- **User input vs. crop needs:** Radar chart visualizes alignment and gaps.
